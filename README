ccopyppaste is a set of command line utilities that bridges the gap between the GUI and the command line.

It allows you to copy/cut from the command line and paste into explorer and other GUI applications and vise versa.

It works with files and text.

Usage:

ccopy *.txt   // copy all txt files to clipboard, can be pasted in explorer
dir | ccopy   // copy output of dir to clipboard, can be pasted in notepad
ppaste        // pastes files on clipboard to currect directory or text on clipboard to console (-v outputs filenames on clipboard to console)
